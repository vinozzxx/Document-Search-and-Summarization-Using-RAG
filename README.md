📄 Document Search and Summarization using Large Language Models (RAG)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Document Search and Summarization system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
The system enables users to upload documents, perform semantic search over the corpus, and generate concise, meaningful summaries based on user queries.

This solution is developed as part of an Interview Assignment focused on leveraging modern NLP and LLM capabilities.

🎯 Objective

The primary goals of this project are:

Efficiently search large text documents

Retrieve the Top-N most relevant document segments

Generate coherent and accurate summaries using an LLM

Support adjustable summary length

Maintain scalability, modularity, and clean code structure

🧠 System Architecture (RAG Pipeline)

Document Ingestion

PDF documents are uploaded to the system

Text Preprocessing

Text extraction, cleaning, and chunking

Embedding Generation

Each text chunk is converted into vector embeddings

Semantic Search

User queries are matched using embedding similarity

LLM-Based Summarization

Retrieved content is summarized using an LLM

📄 Data Preparation

Documents are uploaded in PDF format

Text is extracted and cleaned

Long documents are split into smaller semantic chunks

Chunking improves retrieval accuracy and reduces token usage

Uploaded PDF visible inside the uploads/ folder.

🔍 Document Search

Users input natural language queries

Queries are converted into vector embeddings

Semantic similarity search retrieves relevant chunks

This approach ensures contextual relevance, not just keyword matching

📑 Top-N Document Retrieval

The system returns the Top-N most relevant document chunks

Ensures accurate grounding for summarization

Improves precision and reduces hallucination

🧠 Document Summarization

Retrieved content is passed to the LLM

The LLM generates a concise, coherent summary

The summary captures the core intent of the documents

📏 Adjustable Summary Length (Bonus)

Users can specify the desired summary length

Supports both short summaries and detailed explanations

Improves usability for different user needs

📸 Optional Screenshot:
Comparison of short vs detailed summaries.

🧪 Evaluation

A subset of the corpus is used for testing

Queries are designed to retrieve known relevant documents

Retrieval relevance is manually verified

Summary quality is evaluated for:

Accuracy

Coherence

Completeness
